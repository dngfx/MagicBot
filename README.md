## Contact/Support
If you need support with setting up this bot it might be an idea to use [BitBot](https://git.io/bitbot) instead, as more support is offered. I will help if I can.

I (df) can be found at [#premium on Rizon](https://qchat.rizon.net/?channels=premium).

Alternatively connect via your irc client irc://irc.rizon.net:+6697/#premium (Must use SSL)
