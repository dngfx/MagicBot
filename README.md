# MagicBot
Python3 event-driven modular IRC bot!

## Setup

good luck

### Requirements
`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Config
See [docs/help/config.md](docs/help/config.md).

### Backups
If you wish to create backups of your BitBot instance (which you should, [borgbackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a good option), I advise backing up the entirety of `~/.magicbot` - where MagicBot by-default keeps config files, database files and rotated log files.
